This file is part of **python-openzwave-emulator** project http://github.com/p/python-openzwave-emulator.
    :platform: Unix, Windows, MacOS X
    :sinopsis: openzwave simulator Python

This project is based on python-openzwave to pass thought hardware zwace device. It use for API developping or testing.
All C++ and cython code are moved.
